# The Pack &amp; Manifest Format

A `crucible compile` run produces two artefacts: a **pack** (the actual context
to feed an agent) and a **manifest** (a JSON audit trail of every decision).
This document specifies both so downstream tools — like the TypeScript explorer
in `explorer/` — can consume them reliably.

## The pack

The pack is a UTF-8 text file. Its first lines are a comment header, followed by
each included file wrapped in `BEGIN`/`END` delimiters:

```
# contextcrucible pack :: demo :: budget=1200 tokens :: used=1178 :: method=dp
# query: budget solver knapsack
# files: 3

===== BEGIN src/budget_solver.rs (546 tokens, grade 83.3, rust) =====
// ... file content ...
===== END src/budget_solver.rs =====

===== BEGIN README.md (311 tokens, grade 30.3, text) =====
# Sample Repository
...
===== END README.md =====
```

Files appear in **fill order** — the order the budget solver committed them,
highest grade first. Every included file is guaranteed to end with a newline
inside its block so concatenation never fuses two files.

## The manifest

The manifest is deterministic, pretty-printed JSON with three top-level keys.

### `summary`

| Field                | Type   | Meaning                                            |
|----------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `tool`               | string | Always `"contextcrucible"`.                        |
| `version`            | string | Crate version that produced the pack.              |
| `label`              | string | The `--label` given at compile time.               |
| `query`              | string | The relevance query (may be empty).                |
| `budget_tokens`      | int    | The hard token budget.                             |
| `tokens_used`        | int    | Tokens actually consumed (always `<= budget`).     |
| `budget_utilization` | float  | `tokens_used / budget_tokens`, `0..=1`.            |
| `captured_value`     | float  | Sum of grades of included files.                   |
| `min_score`          | float  | The relevance floor applied.                       |
| `solver_method`      | string | `"dp"`, `"greedy"`, or `"empty"`.                  |
| `counts`             | object | Per-disposition file counts (see below).           |

`counts` has: `included`, `excluded_secret`, `excluded_budget`,
`excluded_low_score`, `excluded_scan`.

### `files`

An array, one object per **evaluated candidate** (files that survived scanning).
Each entry explains its fate:

```json
{
  "path": "src/budget_solver.rs",
  "decision": "include",
  "tokens": 546,
  "bytes": 1139,
  "grade": 83.25,
  "language": "rust",
  "score_parts": { "path": 16.67, "query": 33.25, "import": 20.0, "symbol": 13.33 },
  "fill_rank": 0,
  "explanation": "included at fill rank 0 — grade 83.2 ..."
}
```

`decision` is one of:

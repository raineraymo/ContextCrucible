//! Token assay.
//!
//! We do **not** claim to reproduce any particular tokenizer's vocabulary — that
//! would require shipping a model's merge table. Instead we use a transparent,
//! deterministic heuristic calibrated against the rough behaviour of byte-pair
//! encoders on source code: tokens tend to break on word boundaries, runs of
//! whitespace collapse, and punctuation is comparatively dense.
//!
//! The estimator is a pure function of the input bytes, so two runs over the
//! same file always agree.

/// Estimate the token mass of a UTF-8 string.
///
/// The heuristic counts *segments*: maximal runs of alphanumeric characters are
/// one segment each but long identifiers are split every four characters (BPE
/// tends to fragment `snake_case_identifiers`), and each punctuation or symbol
/// character counts as its own segment. Whitespace runs collapse to a single
/// low-cost segment. The result is clamped to at least 1 for non-empty input.
